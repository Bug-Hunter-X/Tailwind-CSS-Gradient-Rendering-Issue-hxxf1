```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-blue-600 to-purple-500">
  {/* ... */}
</div>
```
This corrected code uses `via-blue-600` to add an intermediate color, which addresses certain gradient issues.  Ensure that your `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured and all necessary dependencies are installed. Check for any conflicting CSS rules that could override the gradient styles.  Consider using a more specific gradient syntax if needed to avoid ambiguity.
